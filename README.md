Most infrastructure automation is built without a delivery model. No consistent stages, no traceability, no repeatable process — just ad hoc builds that are hard to maintain, document, or hand off.

This repository introduces **Spec-Driven Development** for infrastructure automation. Every delivery follows six structured stages, with AI agents executing each stage and engineers approving the artifacts that gate the next one.

```
Requirements → Feasibility →   Design    →  Build   →    Test    →  As-Built
      │              │             │            │             │            │
 /spec-agent   /solution-     /solution-   /builder-     /qa-agent   /qa-agent
                arch-agent     arch-agent    agent
      │              │             │            │             │            │
  customer-      feasibility.md solution-    assets     test-plan.md  as-built.md
  spec.md        (approved)     design.md   (delivered) (approved),   (approved)
  (approved)                    (approved)              test-report.md
```

The result is infrastructure automation that is traceable, repeatable, and delivered faster.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Itential Platform | 6.x | Target platform for every skill |
| IAG | 5.x | Only for the `/iag` skill |
| AI coding tool | — | [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) is the primary target (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, or `claude plugin install`). GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Codex CLI each install `plugin.json` + `skills/` directly, or read their own local-repo mirror (`.github/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`). See `AGENTS.md` and `docs/vendor-install.md`. |

---

## Getting Started

**Install:**

| Tool | Steps |
|------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | `/plugin marketplace add itential/builder-skills` then `/plugin install itential-builder@itential-builder`. Update anytime with `/plugin update itential-builder@itential-builder`. |
| **Codex CLI** | `codex plugin marketplace add itential/builder-skills` registers this repo (reads `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`), then install it from Codex's Plugins UI. |
| **GitHub Copilot** | No install step. Clone or open this repo — Copilot's coding agent reads `.claude/skills` directly. |
| **Cursor** | No install step. Clone or open this repo — Cursor auto-discovers skills from `.agents/skills` on start. |

**First-time setup:**

Create a folder for your use case and copy the environment template that matches your platform:

```bash
mkdir my-use-case
cp environments/cloud-lab.env my-use-case/.env   # Cloud / OAuth
# or: cp environments/local-dev.env my-use-case/.env   (Local / Password)
# or: cp environments/staging.env my-use-case/.env
cd my-use-case
```

Open `.env` and fill in your values — `PLATFORM_URL`, plus either `CLIENT_ID`/`CLIENT_SECRET` (OAuth) or `USERNAME`/`PASSWORD` (local dev).

Then start your first delivery from inside that folder:

```
/itential-builder:spec-agent
```

See [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md) for the full setup and first delivery walkthrough.

For install and invocation per tool (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot), see [`docs/vendor-install.md`](docs/vendor-install.md). For the source/generated model, see [`docs/multi-vendor-architecture.md`](docs/multi-vendor-architecture.md). For governance, see [`docs/constitution.md`](docs/constitution.md).

## How to Use It

```
"I need to automate VLAN provisioning on my platform"
→ /itential-builder:spec-agent

"I have a FlowAgent that's been running in production — productionize it"
→ /itential-builder:flowagent-to-spec

"I have an existing project with no documentation"
→ /itential-builder:project-to-spec

"Document all my global workflows and group them by use case"
→ /itential-builder:documentation

"I want to explore what's available on my platform"
→ /itential-builder:explore

"Am I ready to move from Gateway 4 (IAG4) to Gateway 5 (IAG5)?"
→ /itential-builder:gateway4-to-gateway5

"Help me build a golden config for my devices and run compliance"
→ /itential-builder:itential-golden-config
```

## Skills

This repository is AAIF-aligned around [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) as the canonical cross-vendor agent guide. Canonical skill content lives in [`skills/`](skills/). Claude compatibility files in `.claude/skills/` are generated from `skills/`; run `scripts/sync-vendor-skills.sh` after editing canonical skills and `scripts/check-vendor-skills.sh` before release.

**Delivery**

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/itential-builder:spec-agent` | Refines a use case into an approved requirements spec (HLD). Picks from 22 built-in specs or starts from scratch. Produces `customer-spec.md` — the input to every downstream stage. |
| `/itential-builder:solution-arch-agent` | Connects to your platform, assesses what it can support, and produces a feasibility decision and a concrete implementation plan. Outputs `feasibility.md` and `solution-design.md`. |
| `/itential-builder:builder-agent` | Implements the approved solution design end-to-end — workflows, templates, configs, projects. Tests each component individually, then hands off to `/qa-agent`. |
| `/itential-builder:qa-agent` | Drafts a test plan from the approved acceptance criteria (engineer approves before anything runs live), generates and runs static + acceptance test cases against the delivered build, and produces `test-report.md` and `as-built.md`. The last technical stage before customer sign-off. |
| `/itential-builder:flowagent-to-spec` | Reads a FlowAgent's config and mission history, reconstructs what it actually did, and produces a `customer-spec.md` for the deterministic equivalent. Turns agentic exploration into a governed delivery path. |
| `/itential-builder:project-to-spec` | Reads an existing Itential project — workflows, templates, MOP — and reverse-engineers a `customer-spec.md` and `solution-design.md`. Use to document undocumented automation or create a baseline for a rebuild. |
| `/itential-builder:documentation` | Surveys global assets on a platform — collects workflows, templates, LCM models, golden config, and OM automations, discovers their relationships, groups them into use cases, and produces `customer-spec.md` + `solution-design.md` per use case plus a master README. Optionally creates a project per use case and moves assets in with a reference impact report. For a named project, use `/project-to-spec` instead. |
| `/itential-builder:explore` | Authenticates to a platform, pulls live data, and lets you browse capabilities freely. Use for ad-hoc investigation before starting a delivery or when you need to work outside the lifecycle. |

**Platform**

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/itential-builder:flowagent` | Creates and runs AI agents on the Itential Platform. Configures LLM providers, registers tools (adapters, workflows, IAG services), and runs agent sessions. Use when building or operating Flow AI agents. |
| `/itential-builder:iag` | Builds and runs IAG 5 services — Python scripts, Ansible playbooks, OpenTofu plans. Manages YAML service definitions, imports via `iagctl`, and calls services from Itential workflows via GatewayManager. |
| `/itential-builder:gateway4-to-gateway5` | Assesses readiness to migrate from Gateway4-IAG4 to Gateway5-IAG5. Scans workflows, JSON forms, scripts, playbooks, and inventory for Gateway4-IAG4 usage (`AGManager` / `automation_gateway`). Produces a deterministic markdown readiness report with a manual-action checklist. Read-only — never modifies the platform. For building Gateway5-IAG5 services after the assessment, use `/iag`. |
| `/itential-builder:itential-mop` | Builds Method of Procedure command templates with variable substitution and validation rules. Runs CLI pre-checks and post-checks against devices, and uses analytic templates for before/after config comparison. |
| `/itential-builder:itential-devices` | Manages network devices in Itential Configuration Manager — onboard devices, take config backups, diff configurations, organize device groups, and apply device templates. |
| `/itential-builder:itential-golden-config` | Builds golden config trees and node-level config specs that define the expected configuration standard for your devices. Runs compliance plans, grades results, and generates remediation configs for violations. |
| `/itential-builder:itential-inventory` | Builds and manages device inventories in Itential Inventory Manager. Populates nodes in bulk, assigns tags, runs actions against inventory devices, and manages inventory-level access and grouping. |
| `/itential-builder:itential-lcm` | Defines reusable service resource models in Itential Lifecycle Manager, creates and manages resource instances, runs lifecycle actions, and tracks execution history. Use for service models that have create, update, and delete lifecycle phases. |
| `/itential-builder:itential-json-forms` | Builds IAP JSON Forms — static-enum dropdowns, REST-bound dropdowns (live data from IAP endpoints), and cascading dropdowns (field dependency). Use when wiring structured input panels for manual triggers or manual tasks. |

## Customization

Every skill above is foundational — owned and updated by Itential. Don't edit a skill's `SKILL.md` directly; those edits get silently overwritten (or produce merge conflicts) the next time this plugin is updated.

Instead, every skill has a `custom/` folder with three layers, read automatically before the skill acts. More specific overrides less specific — `dev` overrides `team` overrides `org` overrides the foundational skill. This works identically across every vendor tool since it lives in the canonical `skills/` tree:

```
skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md              ← foundational, Itential-owned — never edit this
└── custom/
    ├── org/                ← company-wide rules (e.g. naming conventions, security policy)
    ├── team/               ← your team's rules
    └── dev/                ← your own local overrides and drafts
```

See [`docs/customization.md`](docs/customization.md) for the full framework — precedence rules, the required format for stating an override, and a decision guide for which layer a given customization belongs in.

**Whether `custom/` content survives an update depends on the vendor and how you installed.** Claude Code's plugin installer is git-based and preserves it automatically (verified); Codex's plugin installer wipes the whole install directory on every update (also verified) and never preserves it. **Cloning or forking the repo directly and running `scripts/update-fork.sh` to pull updates is the only path verified safe across every vendor** — see [`docs/customization.md`](docs/customization.md) for the per-vendor breakdown and full setup.

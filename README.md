Most infrastructure automation is built without a delivery model. No consistent stages, no traceability, no repeatable process — just ad hoc builds that are hard to maintain, document, or hand off.

This repository introduces **Spec-Driven Development** for infrastructure automation. Every delivery follows six structured stages, with AI agents executing each stage and engineers approving the artifacts that gate the next one.

```
Requirements → Feasibility →   Design    →  Build   →    Test    →  As-Built
      │              │             │            │             │            │
 /spec-agent   /solution-     /solution-   /builder-     /qa-agent   /qa-agent
                arch-agent     arch-agent    agent
      │              │             │            │             │            │
  customer-      feasibility.md solution-    assets     test-plan.md  as-built.md
  spec.md        (approved)     design.md   (delivered) (approved),   (approved)
  (approved)                    (approved)              test-report.md
```

The result is infrastructure automation that is traceable, repeatable, and delivered faster.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Itential Platform | 6.x | Target platform for every skill |
| IAG | 5.x | Only for the `/iag` skill |
| AI coding tool | — | Claude Code, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot, or Cursor |

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install for your tool

| Tool | Install |
|------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | `/plugin marketplace add itential/builder-skills` then `/plugin install itential-builder@itential-builder` |
| **Codex CLI** | `codex plugin marketplace add itential/builder-skills` then `codex plugin add itential-builder@itential-builder` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `gh skill install itential/builder-skills --agent github-copilot --all` |
| **Cursor** | `git clone https://github.com/itential/builder-skills.git` and open the folder |

How to check it worked, run skills, and update — per tool: [`docs/vendor-install.md`](docs/vendor-install.md).

> **Your org wants its own rules** (naming, design standards, policies)? Set up your org's copy first and install from that instead — [`docs/customization.md`](docs/customization.md). You can also start with Itential's and switch later; it's just a reinstall.

### 2. Connect to your platform

Make a folder for your use case, with a `.env` holding your platform credentials:

```bash
mkdir my-use-case && cd my-use-case
cat > .env <<'EOF'
PLATFORM_URL=https://your-instance.itential.io
AUTH_METHOD=oauth
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
EOF
```

On a local/dev platform with a username and password, use `AUTH_METHOD=password` with `USERNAME=` and `PASSWORD=` instead of the client ID/secret. You authenticate once; every skill reuses it.

### 3. Verify it's working

Open your tool in that folder and ask:

> "I want to automate VLAN provisioning on my platform."

The agent should start the **spec-agent** skill, offer the built-in VLAN Provisioning spec, and ask you about scope — rather than jumping straight to writing code. You can also start it directly: `/itential-builder:spec-agent` (Claude Code), `$spec-agent` (Codex), `/spec-agent` (Copilot, Cursor).

Next: the full first-delivery walkthrough in [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md).

### Staying up to date

**Watch → Custom → Releases** on this repo to hear about new versions, then update with your tool's command in [`docs/vendor-install.md`](docs/vendor-install.md). Claude Code updates on its own.

## How to Use It

```
"I need to automate VLAN provisioning on my platform"
→ /itential-builder:spec-agent

"I have a FlowAgent that's been running in production — productionize it"
→ /itential-builder:flowagent-to-spec

"I have an existing project with no documentation"
→ /itential-builder:project-to-spec

"Document all my global workflows and group them by use case"
→ /itential-builder:documentation

"I want to explore what's available on my platform"
→ /itential-builder:explore

"Am I ready to move from Gateway 4 (IAG4) to Gateway 5 (IAG5)?"
→ /itential-builder:gateway4-to-gateway5

"Help me build a golden config for my devices and run compliance"
→ /itential-builder:itential-golden-config
```

## Skills

This repository is AAIF-aligned around [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) as the canonical cross-vendor agent guide. Canonical skill content lives in [`skills/`](skills/). `.claude/skills/` (Claude Code), `.agents/skills/` (Codex CLI, Cursor), and `.github/skills/` (GitHub Copilot) are real-copy mirrors regenerated from `skills/` by CI (`.github/workflows/generate-mirrors.yml`) on every push to `main` — edit `skills/` only.

**Delivery**

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/itential-builder:spec-agent` | Refines a use case into an approved requirements spec (HLD). Picks from 22 built-in specs or starts from scratch. Produces `customer-spec.md` — the input to every downstream stage. |
| `/itential-builder:solution-arch-agent` | Connects to your platform, assesses what it can support, and produces a feasibility decision and a concrete implementation plan. Outputs `feasibility.md` and `solution-design.md`. |
| `/itential-builder:builder-agent` | Implements the approved solution design end-to-end — workflows, templates, configs, projects. Tests each component individually, then hands off to `/qa-agent`. |
| `/itential-builder:qa-agent` | Drafts a test plan from the approved acceptance criteria (engineer approves before anything runs live), generates and runs static + acceptance test cases against the delivered build, and produces `test-report.md` and `as-built.md`. The last technical stage before customer sign-off. |
| `/itential-builder:flowagent-to-spec` | Reads a FlowAgent's config and mission history, reconstructs what it actually did, and produces a `customer-spec.md` for the deterministic equivalent. Turns agentic exploration into a governed delivery path. |
| `/itential-builder:project-to-spec` | Reads an existing Itential project — workflows, templates, MOP — and reverse-engineers a `customer-spec.md` and `solution-design.md`. Use to document undocumented automation or create a baseline for a rebuild. |
| `/itential-builder:documentation` | Surveys global assets on a platform — collects workflows, templates, LCM models, golden config, and OM automations, discovers their relationships, groups them into use cases, and produces `customer-spec.md` + `solution-design.md` per use case plus a master README. Optionally creates a project per use case and moves assets in with a reference impact report. For a named project, use `/project-to-spec` instead. |
| `/itential-builder:explore` | Authenticates to a platform, pulls live data, and lets you browse capabilities freely. Use for ad-hoc investigation before starting a delivery or when you need to work outside the lifecycle. |

**Platform**

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/itential-builder:flowagent` | Creates and runs AI agents on the Itential Platform. Configures LLM providers, registers tools (adapters, workflows, IAG services), and runs agent sessions. Use when building or operating Flow AI agents. |
| `/itential-builder:iag` | Builds and runs IAG 5 services — Python scripts, Ansible playbooks, OpenTofu plans. Manages YAML service definitions, imports via `iagctl`, and calls services from Itential workflows via GatewayManager. |
| `/itential-builder:gateway4-to-gateway5` | Assesses readiness to migrate from Gateway4-IAG4 to Gateway5-IAG5. Scans workflows, JSON forms, scripts, playbooks, and inventory for Gateway4-IAG4 usage (`AGManager` / `automation_gateway`). Produces a deterministic markdown readiness report with a manual-action checklist. Read-only — never modifies the platform. For building Gateway5-IAG5 services after the assessment, use `/iag`. |
| `/itential-builder:itential-mop` | Builds Method of Procedure command templates with variable substitution and validation rules. Runs CLI pre-checks and post-checks against devices, and uses analytic templates for before/after config comparison. |
| `/itential-builder:itential-devices` | Manages network devices in Itential Configuration Manager — onboard devices, take config backups, diff configurations, organize device groups, and apply device templates. |
| `/itential-builder:itential-golden-config` | Builds golden config trees and node-level config specs that define the expected configuration standard for your devices. Runs compliance plans, grades results, and generates remediation configs for violations. |
| `/itential-builder:itential-inventory` | Builds and manages device inventories in Itential Inventory Manager. Populates nodes in bulk, assigns tags, runs actions against inventory devices, and manages inventory-level access and grouping. |
| `/itential-builder:itential-lcm` | Defines reusable service resource models in Itential Lifecycle Manager, creates and manages resource instances, runs lifecycle actions, and tracks execution history. Use for service models that have create, update, and delete lifecycle phases. |
| `/itential-builder:itential-json-forms` | Builds IAP JSON Forms — static-enum dropdowns, REST-bound dropdowns (live data from IAP endpoints), and cascading dropdowns (field dependency). Use when wiring structured input panels for manual triggers or manual tasks. |

## Customization

Want the skills to follow your org's rules — naming conventions, design standards, change policy? Don't edit a skill's `SKILL.md` (updates would overwrite it). Each skill has a `custom/` folder for your rules instead:

```
skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md          ← Itential's — never edit
└── custom/
    ├── org/          ← company-wide rules
    ├── team/         ← your team's rules
    └── dev/          ← personal settings (not committed)
```

How it works, in four steps:
1. **Once:** an admin makes a private copy of this repo for your org.
2. **Add a rule:** commit a markdown file under the right skill's `custom/` folder and push. A pipeline in the repo delivers it to every AI tool — no scripts.
3. **Install:** everyone installs from your org's copy instead of Itential's.
4. **Updates:** pull Itential's releases into your copy as you normally sync from upstream. Your rules are never touched.

Step-by-step guide, with what to check at each step: [`docs/customization.md`](docs/customization.md).

# Quickstart Guide

Infrastructure delivery has never had a real operating model. Teams build automation ad hoc — no consistent structure, no traceability, no repeatable process from requirements through delivery.

These skills introduce a new way of working: **Spec-Driven Development** for infrastructure automation. Every delivery follows the same six stages — Requirements → Feasibility → Design → Build → Test → As-Built — with AI agents doing the heavy lifting at each stage and engineers approving the artifacts that move it forward.

The result is infrastructure automation that is traceable, repeatable, and delivered faster.

---

## How It Works

```
Requirements → Feasibility → Design → Build → Test → As-Built
```

Each stage has a named agent, a clear input, and an artifact the engineer approves before moving forward. Nothing skips a stage. Nothing moves without sign-off.

---

## Four Ways to Work

**01 — Deliver from Spec**
End-to-end delivery with artifact-based approvals at every stage.
```
/itential-builder:spec-agent → /itential-builder:solution-arch-agent → /itential-builder:builder-agent → /itential-builder:qa-agent
```

**02 — FlowAgent to Spec**
An agent proves a pattern. Spec-Driven Development productionizes it as a deterministic workflow.
```
/itential-builder:flowagent-to-spec → /itential-builder:solution-arch-agent → /itential-builder:builder-agent → /itential-builder:qa-agent
```

**03 — Generate Spec from Project**
Existing automation, no documentation. Extract the spec and design from what was built.
```
/itential-builder:project-to-spec
```

**04 — Explore**
Connect to a platform, browse capabilities, build freely. No lifecycle required.
```
/itential-builder:explore
```

## 1. Install the Plugin

Follow your tool's section in [`vendor-install.md`](vendor-install.md) — install, then its "check it worked" step. Your org has its own customized copy? Install from that instead (same page explains).

This guide uses Claude Code's `/itential-builder:skill-name` syntax. On other tools, use the same skill name: `$spec-agent` in Codex, `/spec-agent` in Copilot and Cursor.

---

## 2. Set Up Your Environment

Make a folder for your use case and put a `.env` in it with your platform credentials:

```bash
mkdir my-use-case && cd my-use-case
```

```bash
# .env — cloud / OAuth
PLATFORM_URL=https://your-platform.itential.io
AUTH_METHOD=oauth
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

```bash
# .env — local / dev platform with a username and password
PLATFORM_URL=http://localhost:4000
AUTH_METHOD=password
USERNAME=admin
PASSWORD=your-password
```

(Working from a clone? The same templates are in `environments/` — `cp environments/cloud-lab.env my-use-case/.env`.)

> The agent reads `.env` automatically — you authenticate once and every skill reuses the token.

---

## 3. Pick Your Flow

### Deliver from Spec _(recommended for new automation)_

Start with a use case, build it end-to-end with full traceability.

```
/itential-builder:spec-agent
```
Claude refines your use case and produces an approved `customer-spec.md`.

```
/itential-builder:solution-arch-agent
```
Claude connects to your platform, assesses feasibility, and produces `solution-design.md`.

```
/itential-builder:builder-agent
```
Claude builds all assets and tests each component individually.

```
/itential-builder:qa-agent
```
Claude drafts a test plan from your acceptance criteria (you approve it before anything runs live), runs static + acceptance tests against the delivered build, and produces `test-report.md` and `as-built.md`.

---

### Explore _(no spec, freestyle)_

Connect to a platform and build freely without following a delivery lifecycle.

```
/itential-builder:explore
```

---

### FlowAgent to Spec _(convert an agent to a workflow)_

Take an existing FlowAgent and convert its proven pattern to a deterministic workflow.

```
/itential-builder:flowagent-to-spec
```
Then continue with `/itential-builder:solution-arch-agent` → `/itential-builder:builder-agent` → `/itential-builder:qa-agent`.

---

### Generate Spec from Project _(document existing automation)_

Read an existing project and extract the spec and solution design.

```
/itential-builder:project-to-spec
```

---

## 4. What Gets Produced

| Stage | Artifact | What It Is |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Requirements | `customer-spec.md` | Approved HLD — scope, flow, acceptance criteria |
| Feasibility | `feasibility.md` | Platform capability assessment |
| Design | `solution-design.md` | Component inventory, adapter mappings, build plan |
| Build | `assets/` | Delivered workflows, templates, configs |
| Test | `test-plan.md`, `test-report.md` | Approved test plan + evidence per acceptance criterion |
| As-Built | `as-built.md` | Delivered state, deviations, learnings |

Each artifact is approved by the engineer before the next stage begins.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

**Auth fails on first run**
- Check `PLATFORM_URL` has no trailing slash
- For OAuth: verify `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` are correct
- For local: default is `USERNAME=admin` / `PASSWORD=admin`

**Skill not found after install**
- Run your tool's "Check it worked" step in [`vendor-install.md`](vendor-install.md)
- Claude Code: restart after installing, then check `/plugin`

**Platform data not pulling**
- Run `/itential-builder:explore` first to confirm connectivity
- Check that your platform is reachable from your machine
